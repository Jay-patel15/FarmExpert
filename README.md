# 🌱 Farm Expert: AI-Powered Crop & Health Management System 🤖  

## Overview  
**Farm Expert** is an **AI-driven agricultural platform** that empowers farmers with **smart decision-making tools** for **crop prediction, fertilizer recommendation, and disease detection**. Using **machine learning (Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree, etc.)** and **deep learning (CNNs)**, the system analyzes **soil quality, weather data, and plant health** to optimize farming practices.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Crop Prediction** – Recommends the best crops based on soil nutrients, temperature, humidity, and rainfall.  
✅ **Fertilizer Recommendation** – Suggests optimal fertilizer composition based on soil and crop requirements.  
✅ **Disease Detection** – Uses **deep learning (CNN)** to analyze leaf images and detect crop diseases.  
✅ **User-Friendly Web Interface** – Built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python (Flask/Streamlit)** for real-time predictions.  
✅ **Scalability & Sustainability** – Designed to **reduce resource wastage, improve yields, and support sustainable farming**.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Machine Learning:** Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes  
- **Deep Learning:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image-based disease detection  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP. 
- **Backend:** Python (Flask/Streamlit)  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, TorchVision  
- **Deployment:** Pickle for model storage, Web-based execution on localhost  

## 📊 Dataset & Model Accuracy  
- **Crop Prediction Accuracy:** Up to **99.09%** (Random Forest, Naïve Bayes)  
- **Fertilizer Recommendation Accuracy:** **100%** (Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression)  
- **Disease Detection:** High-accuracy **CNN model** trained on plant leaf images  

## 🖥️ How It Works  
1️⃣ Users input **soil and environmental parameters** (NPK, pH, humidity, temperature, rainfall).  
2️⃣ The **machine learning model predicts** the best crops or fertilizers based on real-time data.  
3️⃣ For **disease detection**, users **upload a leaf image**, and the deep learning model diagnoses the issue and suggests treatments.  

## 🎯 Impact  
🌾 **Empowers farmers** with **data-driven insights** for **higher yield & sustainability**  
🌎 **Promotes precision agriculture** by **minimizing fertilizer waste & crop loss**  
🚀 **Bridges the gap** between **traditional farming & AI-driven smart agriculture**
